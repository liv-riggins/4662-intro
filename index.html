<h2>Hi, I'm Liv.</h2>

<p>I'm a senior at the University of Minnesota, pursuing a B.S. in Technical Writing & Communication with a second major in English and minors in Digital Media Studies and Interdisciplinary Design.
I work as a writing consultant at the UMN's Center for Writing and am also interning at First Avenue for this semester. Outside of school and work, I like to do long-distance running, cross-country ski, backpack, cook, and go to concerts. As long as I'm an intern, I get into any First Avenue-run event free, so I'm going to as many shows as I can this semester! I used to play violin, piano, guitar, accordion, and electronic synth but have been too busy to really practice any of those since starting college. I'd love to pick those back up and also start a veggie garden. </p>

<h2>Skills</h2>

<p>Through my earlier major in architecture, I've gained a lot of experience with the Adobe Creative Suite. This summer, I learned XML and Adobe FrameMaker as a technical writing intern at Graco, Inc. I've also learned HTML/CSS through coursework in the IT and Design suplan, and am now learning git and GitHub through this class.
<h2>Academic Interests</h2>

<p>I'm most interested in studying and learning about topics at the intersection of writing and design. Over the course of this year, I'll be completing a Summa thesis that includes conducting usability testing on a health intervention software, analyzing results, and (based on those results) creating prototypes for how the user interface could be redesigned for increased usability.  </p>
